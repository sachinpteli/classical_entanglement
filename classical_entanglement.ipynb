        "The underlying idea is to first project the spatial mode of the radially polarized beam into four spatial modes $\\{\\psi_{10}, \\psi_{01}, \\psi_{+},\\psi_{L} \\}$ and then these separated beams postselect the polarizations states $\\{\\textbf{e}_{x},\\textbf{e}_{y},\\textbf{e}_{+},\\textbf{e}_{R} \\}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Postselection refers to conditioning the probabilities of possible outcomes of an event on some other given event. In our case, we condition the probabilities of measuring different polarization DoFs on the occurence of spatial DoFs. Necessity of postselection and its implication is reflected in the improvement of the rate of Fischer Information (average information learned about an unknown parameter from a trial) to cost [1]."

The three bases that we use in this experiment are: $\\{\\psi_{L}, \\psi_{R}\\}$ (circular), $\\{\\psi_{+}, \\psi_{-}\\}$ (diagonal), and $\\{\\psi_{10}, \\psi_{01}\\}$ (horizontal and vertical).\n",

Recall that circular and diagonal polarizations can be written as a suitable linear combination of $\\psi_{10} $ and $\\psi_{01} $ so what a MBS essentially does is just a change of basis and then separating the two orthogonal vectors based on their coefficients for  $\\psi_{10} $ and $\\psi_{01} $. For MC C, no change of basis is required. So, **MC C** if at all being a physical device, would perform identity operation only."
